# ADAS_perception

A discrete choice research into the perception of the impact of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) on comfort and safety of lease cars. The final report for this research can be found here: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Aed189e28-7dd7-4bce-8ceb-d6fa8686d222
This research consisted of 2 parts. 
1. The effect of ADAS configuration on Perceived Internal Safety (PIS), Perceived External Safety (PES) and Perceived Comfort (PC). This is estimated with a Ordinal Logistic Regression. The respondents had to rate each package on those three metrics.
2. After rating three different packages, the respondent had to choose between these three packages. 

- I created a survey. 
- A Ordinal Logistic regression was estimated, to see how people arrive at each perception rating for ADAS pacakges. To be specific in the type of regression: Cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds. This type of ordinal regression uses cumulative categories representing the perception ratings.
- From the observed choices, discrete choice models are estimated that indicates whether Perceived Internal Safety (PIS), Perceived External Safety (PES), Perceived Comfort (PC), Luxurious features (LUX) or Price (PR) have a stronger effect on utility, and as such on choices
